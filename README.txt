This is an AI script for a game called war of life. The rules are as follows:

For each of the (64) cells C on the board:
If C contains a piece and the piece is surrounded by 0 or 1 other pieces, then the piece dies of loneliness and is taken away (i.e., the cell becomes empty).

If C contains a piece and the piece is surrounded by 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 pieces, then the piece dies of overcrowding and is taken away.
(If C contains a piece and the piece is surrounded by 2 or 3 pieces, then it is happy and survives.)

If C is empty and C is surrounded by 
2 blue pieces and 1 red piece,  or
3 blue pieces,
then a blue life is born and C is filled with a blue piece. 

If C is empty and C is surrounded by 
2 red pieces and 1 blue piece,  or
3 red pieces, 
then a red life is born and C is filled with a red piece.
